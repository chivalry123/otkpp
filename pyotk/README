Introduction
------------

PyOTK is a Python extension for OTK++. It uses Boost.Python 
for exposing the OTK++ classes into Python. Several classes 
and functions for analyzing and visualizing the behaviour of 
minimization algorithms are implemented in PyOTK.

Requirements
------------

As PyOTK is an extension of OTK++, it requires that the OTK++ 
libraries, and they must be installed with either the prefix 
/usr or /usr/local.

PyOTK has been tested to compile with Python 2.5/2.6 and 
Boost.Python 1.34. Python 3.0 and newer are not currently 
supported. PyOTK also requires the following Python libraries:

  Matplotlib  >=  0.98
  NumPy       >=  1.1.0
  SciPy       >=  0.6.0

Installation
------------

PyOTK uses distutils for compiling the C++ interface libraries 
and copying the Python scripts to appropriate directories in 
the system path. To install PyOTK, extract the pyotk tarball 
and type the following command:

  python setup.py install

NOTE: The functionality of the Python interface depends 
on the flags the OTK++ library was compiled with. The setup.py 
script automatically parses the configuration file generated 
by the OTK++ install script and reads the variables it 
was configured with.
